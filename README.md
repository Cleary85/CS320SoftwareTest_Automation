How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure that something is working proerly is to test it. While functionality and security testing evaluate the robustness of a code base for different metrics, they are both
important aspects that should be tested prior to operation to ensure that the code is doing what it should and that the code does not create vectors for harm to the users or system.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
There are multiple ways in which you could interpret a user's needs, such as user case and questionaires to name a few. Ultimately using multiple methods help ensure that a complete picture is
gleaned to help inform the design of the software. Once the software is designed, testing based on those requirements will help verify that the software does meet those needs and provides
confidence to both the designer and the user.

How do I approach designing software?
Once I have the requirements, I will start to map out, first at a high level, what the software will require to meet those requirements. This involves figuring out what variables, arrays, 
interfaces, etc, mush be present. From there, deciding on how those peices will need to interact in order to function. After that, drawing up pseudocode and then code that will operate what I
invision for the software. While coding, I will do portions or section of the code and test if it is indeed functioning as intended with proper inputs. After I get a couple of sections done, I would test those sections with good and bad inputs to check error handling and proper function. Once these are successful, I would develop formal testing from the requirements and test the code wiht these tests, with a focus on ensuring proper coverage and adherance to the requirements.
